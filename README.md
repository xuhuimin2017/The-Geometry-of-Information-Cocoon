We construct the cultural space with word embedding models among three large-scale datasets of digital media use. Our analysis reveals that information cocoons widely exist in the daily use of digital media across mobile apps, mobile reading and computer use. Moreover, people of lower social class have a higher probability of being stuck in the information cocoon filled with the content of entertainment. In contrast, the people of higher social class have more capability to stride over the constraints of information cocoon.

To protect the privacy of users, the behavioral datasets are only available through collaborations. If you are interested in this project, please email me at huiminxu1024@163.com.
